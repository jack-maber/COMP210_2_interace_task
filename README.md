# COMP210_2_interace_task

For my interface task I will be basing it on my comp230 collaborative game, which is an office chair racing game at it's lowest level, which is an idea which has not been developed upon according to my groups' research, making it the perfect platform for further development for an AR/VR task as I think that the gameplay and the way the player views the game would be a very interesting and unique experience that would be futher enhanced by the use of AR/VR technology. 

The VR/AR market is a very broad market in terms of both hardware and software and has a variety of uses outside of gaming such as CAD design and Architectual planning, meaning that sales numbers of AR/VR devices have made a steady increase since the "VR Boom" a couple of years ago, with devices such as the Samsung Gear VR having sold 5 Million units by January of this year[1], so it's a market with a significant user base that can be tapped into, especially devices such as the Google Cardboard, which can be accessed by nearly anyone with an Android Phone, with nearly 10 Million Cardboard units being sold, and 160 Million downloads of Cardboard supported apps[1], it is clear that VR is defienetly a platform worth taking note of when developing applications. 

My prototype will place the player in a virtual environment, based on my comp230 project, where the player has to navigate a track on said office chair, but instead of having the camera in a 3rd person, the view will be from a first person perspective, with a UI overlayed onto the screen, with information such as how many laps the player has remaining, what position they are in and so on, this UI could be adapted from my exisiting project and repurpoused or be created from scratch but I will discover that further along the line. Having the player control the camera by moving their head will allow for a much more immersive experience and will allow for greater degree of gameplay control, giving the player an edge over perhaps if they weren't using VR. 

# The prototype must fill these key requirements:
Make good use of either VR/AR technology to provide an immersive experience
Utilise a clear and logical interface
Be able to be used by a variety of player
Be able to be used on a variety of platforms
